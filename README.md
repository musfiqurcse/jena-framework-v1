#JENA Framework

Semantic web are resources for human. The goal of semantic web is to lead the data which is understandable for both human and machine. It is an extension of the web for providing an infrastructure for integration of data on the web

## RDF Overview
1. RDF stands for Resource Description Framework
2. It describes resources & propertise in a unique fashion.
3. It describes a statement in a form of relationship between a subject and an object.

##Example:
`Mark Zuckerbug is the owner of Facebook`'
Here...
`Mark Zuckerbug` is the subject.
`Facebook` is the object
`IsTheOwner` is building the relationship between `Mark Zuckerbug` & `Facebook`, hence it becomes predicate. 

This codebase is the example of simple solution of some rdf file data processing through `Apache Jena Framework`.
